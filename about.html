          <h3>About SmartEd</h3>
          <p>
            SmartEd was born out of a shared frustration: long, boring lessons,
            confusing explanations, and tools that just didn’t help. So a group
            of students, the <b> Hello Physics! </b> team, came together to
            create something better. With SmartEd, learning is more engaging,
            more practical, and a lot more relatable. The content is clear,
            interactive, and to the point, and the design makes it easy to stay
            focused and actually enjoy learning.

            SmartEd is more than just an app or website — it’s a growing
            community of learners helping each other grow. It’s a place where
            students don’t just consume content, they shape it. And that’s what
            makes all the difference. Because when students build for students,
            real learning happens

            More than just lessons and quizzes, SmartEd is a space where
            students connect, ask questions, and grow together. It's built
            around the idea that learning is better when it's shared, powered by
            real conversations, peer support, and a sense of belonging.

            SmartEd breaks away from textbook jargon and over-complicated
            lessons. It delivers content the way students actually talk, think,
            and learn. Whether it’s through visuals, examples, or bite-sized
            explanations, SmartEd meets you where you are, not where the
            curriculum assumes you should be.
